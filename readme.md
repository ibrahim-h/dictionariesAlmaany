This addon helps you get the meaning of single words through the almaany.com website.  
[almaany.com](https://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/ "With a Title").

notice: All dictionaries used are bilingual, meaning that for instance, the arabic english dictionary translates from arabic to english and from english to arabic also.
